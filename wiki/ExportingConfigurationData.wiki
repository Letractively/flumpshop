= Introduction =

The most sure fire way of making sure you have everything you need from the site in the event of a failure is by exporting the site, which can then later be restored using the [ImportingConfigurationData Import] feature in the [AdminCP Admin CP].


= Details =

An exported configuration file includes the following:
  * Products
  * Categories
  * Orders
  * Users
  * Customers
  * News Posts
  * The Full [ConfigurationObject Configuration Object], including server specific settings and static page content

To export a file, simply got to the Admin CP, and under the [AdvancedMenu Advanced Menu], click Export. Click the export link, and once the file is generated, you will be prompted to download it.

= Limitations =
* You cannot currently disable the importing of the Configuration Object. Transferring data between servers with different setups will break the system. To fix this, re-run the [SetupWizard Setup Wizard]
