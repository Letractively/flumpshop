= Introduction =

If enabled, Flumpshop displays a link on every storefront page that allows visitors to provide their input into the site. It may be about a bug on the site, or an enquiry into a product, but it is a useful tool.

Further development of a forms system is planned in future.


= Details =

Once feedback has been submitted by a user, it is available in Advanced->Feedback in the Admin CP. This requries the [SecondTierAdmin] Password currently.

Enabling and disabling this feature can be done in the [ConfigurationManager].
