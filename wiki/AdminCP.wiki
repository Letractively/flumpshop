= Introduction =

The Admin CP is the first port of call for changing anything on the site. It lets you do anything, from creating a new product or category to viewing orders and changing the content of static pages. It can be accessed by navigation to the /admin directory within the main directory of the shop.

The Admin CP currently uses a single authentication method - an Administrator Password stored in the [ConfigurationObject]. This is set up as part of the [SetupWizard], and cannot currently be changed within the system.


= Using the Admin CP =
After logging in, the site will load a menu on the left of the page, which allows you to select a task. Note: You may have to refresh the page to see this - [http://code.google.com/p/flumpshop/issues/detail?id=1 See Issue 1] for details.

== Top Level Menus ==
 *[CreateObject] - Create a new object for the site
 *[EditObject] - Edit an existing object or static page
 *[ViewOrders] - View and update orders
 *[DeliverySettings] - Configure delivery options
 *[Waves] - Development
 *[Advanced] - Access advanced settings and direct [ConfigurationObject] editing

Close is not a menu, but simply closes the current Admin module.
