#summary A quick guide to importing a configuration file
#labels Featured,Type-Administration

= Introduction =

An easy way to quickly see all the features of the project is to import a data file. It can be downloaded from the downloads section in Google Code, or exported from an existing site using the [ExportingConfigurationData Export] feature in the [AdminCP Admin CP].


= Details =

An exported configuration file includes the following:
  * Products
  * Categories
  * Orders
  * Users
  * Customers
  * News Posts
  * The Full [ConfigurationObject Configuration Object], including server specific settings and static page content

To import a file, simply got to the Admin CP, and under the [AdvancedMenu Advanced Menu], click Import. There, browse to the downloaded or previously exported file, and click upload. The system will automatically make all the changes necessary.

= Limitations =
* You cannot currently disable the importing of the Configuration Object. Transferring data between servers with different setups will break the system. To fix this, re-run the [SetupWizard Setup Wizard]
