#summary Execute PHP Directly in the Flumpshop environment
#labels Phase-Deploy

=Introduction=
*This feature is for advanced users only. Not only could you break Flumpshop or delete data unintentionally, you could also break the server the system is running on if you're not careful. Don't touch it unless you completely understand what you are doing, i.e. are a Flumpshop developer*

This feature requires the [SecondTierAdmin] Password.

Flumpshop is designed with the idea of being able to control everything simply and easily. However, sometimes there is something you want to do that Flumpshop might not have a button for. So, it provides the next best thing - a button that will let you tell it what you want it to do.

This feature runs directly in a post-initialised Flumpshop script, so you have coplete access to the Database Object, Configuration Object, and many other Flumpshop resources, giving you complete control and access to the resources you need. Be careful with what you do, as Flumpshop can't interpret your actions and guess your intentions.
