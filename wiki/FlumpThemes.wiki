#summary Initial Design notes for installing and customising themes
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
A planned feature for flumpshop is complete customisation of the theme.

  * Widgets
  * Colours
  * Fonts
  * Vertical/Horizontal Scrolling
  * Element widths/heights
  * Show/hide navigation on subpages

= Basic Implementation =
Basic styles can already be changed by creating a custom JQueryUI Theme at http://www.jqueryui.com/themeroller.

The system should be able to dynamically generate new styles (use [offlineDir]) within the [AdminCP Admin CP]

= Possible Advanced Features =
Add drag/drop elements and widgets on the home page as well as removing/adding new ones

Import .fsx theme files (FlumpShopXML) and store them in a library (offlineDir again)
