#summary The Coupon Code system
#labels Phase-Design

As part of the complete Basket structural revamp, coupons will finally be integrated. This provides basic notes.

The system currently contains a table for this purpose, but is only used for account email confirmation. This is done by the action field being executed as an SQL query. I plan to drop this column alongside expiryAction, and create two new tables - keys_action and keys_expiry, which will contain the necessary data.

keys_action
|| keyID || Action ||
|| 1 || Activate_Acc[1] ||
|| 2 || Basket_Total[-10%] ||
|| 3 || Basket_Delivery[0] ||
|| 4 || Item10_Price_GBP[0.99] ||
