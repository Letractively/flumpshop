= Introduction =
The Setup Wizard is the first thing you will see when you extract your Flumpshop Installation. However, the entire Setup Wizard has followed the path of the ACP, and has been completely designed to be more dynamic and extensive.

= Notes =
There is not enough reason (or willpower) to rewrite this page for the new setup wizard, as it now provides helpful tips during setup, in the way of question mark buttons and witty humour.

The new setup wizard is not currently stage complete, but regardless of the chosen setup mode, incomplete ones will automatically forward to the new one.
