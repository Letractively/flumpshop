The Flumpnet Robot is the happy little computer that sits behind the scenes on each Flumpnet project. Always cheerful and willing to help, without him, the Flumpshop wouldn't work.

He has been known to sometimes use the alias 'Donald' in some Flumpnet projects to keep himself hidden and seem a little more human if found.
